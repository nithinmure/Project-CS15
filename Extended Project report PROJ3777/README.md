**Project Coordinator:** Dr. Arun Kumar

## 🚀 **Project Overview:**
Ensuring fairness during examinations has always been challenging, especially with the rise of sophisticated cheating techniques. The **AI-Powered Exam Supervision Monitoring System** aims to tackle this issue by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence models to detect cheating behaviors in real-time.

Initially focused on analyzing static images, the system has evolved to support real-time video processing, making it a comprehensive solution for modern exam environments. The project integrates **YOLOv11** for object detection, **TensorFlow**, and **OpenCV** for efficient video analysis, enabling the identification of suspicious behaviors such as unauthorized device usage, communication attempts, and irregular movements.

## 🎯 **Objectives:**
1. **Real-Time Video Processing and Anomaly Detection:**
   - Detect potential cheating activities like unauthorized movements, identity mismatches, and irregular behavior during exams.
   - Process high-quality video streams with minimal latency.

2. **Integration of Multi-Modal Data:**
   - Incorporate audio analysis and biometric data (eye-tracking, posture recognition) to enhance detection accuracy.
   - Combine multiple data sources for a robust anomaly detection system.

3. **User-Friendly Interface for Supervisors:**
   - Develop an intuitive dashboard for monitoring multiple candidates simultaneously.
   - Provide real-time alerts and detailed reports for flagged incidents.

## 📊 **Key Features:**
- Real-time monitoring using YOLOv11 and TensorFlow.
- High detection accuracy (>90%) achieved through advanced data augmentation techniques (grayscale conversion, blurring, noise addition).
- Dynamic logging and alert system for suspicious behaviors.
- Scalable solution for both in-person and remote examinations.

## 📈 **Outcomes:**
- **Mini Project (PROJ2999) Outcome:**
  - Developed an intelligent exam supervision system capable of real-time cheating detection.
  - Improved model robustness through data augmentation.
  - Achieved over 90% detection accuracy after training for 50 epochs.
